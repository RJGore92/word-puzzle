# Epicodus Intro to Programming Unit 3.2: Word Puzzle

#### Project 2 in Epicodus Unit 3.2: Looping with for.  01/31/2019 start date, 01/31/2019 initial finalization date.

#### By **Robert James "Jimmy" Gore**

## Description

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate looping with for loops to create a word puzzle by removing vowels and converting them to a hyphen symbol while leaving consonants intact and unchanged. Specs and examples will be listed below.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Install Git Bash for Git repository cloning of the project
* Install Atom for review and edit of Code
* To access repository for project and review code, first clone repository at the appropriate link, then use Git Bash and/or Atom to open the project folder.
* GitHub Repository link is https://github.com/RJGore92/word-puzzle.

## Known Bugs

No known bugs are present in this project.

## Assignment Specs

1. The project starts out by requesting an input string.  This string has no limit in how long it can be, but requires at least a single character within it to convert to a puzzle (requires the input field to not be empty).
2. The project then converts the string into an aray, and using a nested for loop and an array variable of vowels, determines which characters in the string are vowels, soon removing them and replacing a hyphen "-" in their position.  Vowels are tracked in uppercase and lowercase.
3. Once the array string has been completely converted to a puzzle, the program then rejoins the text and outputs it into the HTML as the encrypted puzzle.

####  Inputs and outputs (examples):

* Input: "test this", output: "t-st th-s".
* Input: "Hello, my name is Jimmy.", output: "H-ll-, my n-m- -s J-mmy."
